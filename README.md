# LaTeX-simple-resume
A simple, two-pages, resume template anyone can use for a clean result

##How-to, quick and to the point
The most straightforward way to use this template is to copy the main file and the images folder (and its contents), upload all of that to Overleaf, the online LaTeX editor, and edit the relevant sections, then export to PDF. Ta-da!

##License
GNU AGPLv3 + additional license info for the images in the license file

##Additional notes
This resume is clean and functional - however my use of LaTeX isn't optimised; I'm hoping to improve that at some point. I'd love to hear from LaTeX experts!

Happy coding and please let me know any comment - welcoming any input!
